# My-Thesis

Here are all the files of my thesis work which was "Protein Secondary Structure Prediction using Graph Neural Network with Ensemble Learning".
In which I have used SVM and Random Forest models.
Firstly, I have encoded all the amino acids of primary sequence and also used another feature called "conformation parameter".
Then I have transformed the sequences in graph form and train them using SVM and Random Forest.
At last, I have predicted 8-states of secondary sequences.
